#### Introduction

The goal of this project is to generate training data for language models (LMs) aimed at proving or generating mathematical theorems. We leverage rewrite rules to transform expressions, exploring a wide range of possibilities through random walks in a graph of expressions. This approach includes a mechanism to take advantage of reversal asymmetries, where certain transformations are easier in one direction than the other. By harnessing these asymmetries, we can generate diverse and challenging training data efficiently.

#### Key Concepts

1. **Rewrite Rules:** These are rules that define how one expression can be transformed into another. For example, a rule might state that \(b \times b\) can be rewritten as \(\text{pow}(b, 2)\).
   
2. **Match Function:** This function checks if a given rewrite rule can be applied to a part of an expression. It involves traversing the expression tree and binding variables to corresponding parts of the expression.

3. **Apply Function:** This function takes the results from the match function and applies the rewrite rule, replacing the matched sub-expression with a new one.

4. **Expression Tree Traversal:** To apply rewrite rules at different levels, we traverse the expression tree, ensuring that all sub-expressions are considered for potential rewrites.


#### Leveraging Reversal Asymmetries

Certain transformations are significantly easier in one direction than the other. For example, differentiation is generally easier than integration. By generating expressions through easy transformations and then reversing the steps, we can create challenging datasets. 

1. **Generate Forward Transformations:** Start with simple expressions and apply rewrite rules to generate more complex expressions.
   
2. **Reverse Transformations:** Apply the inverse of the rewrite rules to these complex expressions to generate the corresponding simpler expressions.

3. **Data Augmentation:** Use these reversed transformations to create pairs of expressions and their proofs, thus enriching the training dataset.

#### Random Walks for Data Generation

To generate diverse training data:
1. **Initial Nodes:** Start with randomly generated initial expressions.
2. **Random Walks:** Perform random walks by applying rewrite rules to explore various transformations.
3. **Record Steps:** Track the sequence of transformations from one expression to another.

By combining these techniques, we can create a robust dataset for training LLMs to handle mathematical proofs and theorem generation.

#### Conclusion

This approach maximizes the exploration of the expression space and leverages reversal asymmetries to efficiently generate a diverse set of training data. The systematic application of rewrite rules at various levels of the expression tree, coupled with random walks, provides a comprehensive framework for generating valuable training data for LLMs in the domain of theorem proving and mathematical theory generation.
