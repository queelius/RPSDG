#### 1. Introduction
This research aims to generate training data for Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging the process of differentiation and integration. The focus will be on starting with functions that have closed-form solutions, computing their derivatives, formulating corresponding differential equations, and then reversing the process to simulate deriving the original functions. This method ensures the training data consists of manageable, closed-form solutions, even if the intermediate steps are complex.

#### 2. Objectives
- Generate robust training data by taking derivatives and solving simple differential equations.
- Focus on functions with closed-form solutions to ensure the reverse process yields closed-form solutions as well.
- Leverage the process of differentiation and integration to create comprehensive training datasets for LLMs.

#### 3. Scope
- Functions with closed-form solutions will be selected.
- Derivatives (first and higher-order) of these functions will be computed.
- Corresponding differential equations will be formulated.
- The reverse process of deriving the original function from its derivatives will be simulated.
- The training data will include the initial function, its derivatives, differential equations, and the steps to reverse the process.

#### 4. Methodology

##### 4.1 Select Functions
- Focus on polynomials, trigonometric functions, exponential functions, and logarithmic functions.
- Ensure all selected functions have closed-form solutions for both differentiation and integration.

##### 4.2 Compute Derivatives
- Calculate first and higher-order derivatives for each selected function.
- Document each step to provide a detailed transformation process.

##### 4.3 Formulate Differential Equations
- Using the computed derivatives, construct differential equations that these functions satisfy.
- Ensure the differential equations are representative of typical problems in calculus and differential equations.

##### 4.4 Reverse Process Simulation
- Start from the derivative or differential equation and work backward to the original function.
- Document each step, including intermediate algebraic manipulations, to ensure clarity and comprehensiveness.

##### 4.5 Example Workflow

###### Step 1: Select Function
\[ f(x) = \sin(x) \cdot e^{x} \]

###### Step 2: Compute Derivatives
First derivative:
\[ f'(x) = e^{x} \cdot \sin(x) + e^{x} \cdot \cos(x) \]

Second derivative:
\[ f''(x) = 2e^{x} \cdot \cos(x) \]

###### Step 3: Formulate Differential Equation
From the first derivative:
\[ y' = e^{x} \cdot \sin(x) + e^{x} \cdot \cos(x) \]

From the second derivative:
\[ y'' = 2e^{x} \cdot \cos(x) \]

###### Step 4: Reverse Process
Given the second-order differential equation:
\[ y'' - 2y' = 0 \]

Solve for \( y \):
1. **Integrate to Find \( y' \):**
   \[ y' = Ce^{2x} \]

2. **Integrate Again to Find \( y \):**
   \[ y = \frac{C}{2}e^{2x} + D \]

Match to the known form:
   - From initial conditions or known functional forms, ensure \( y = \sin(x) \cdot e^{x} \).

#### 5. Challenges and Considerations
- Ensuring all selected functions and their corresponding differential equations have closed-form solutions.
- Documenting the step-by-step process for reversing the differentiation to ensure clarity.
- Handling the complexity of intermediate algebraic manipulations and ensuring they are accurate and comprehensive.

#### 6. Expected Outcomes
- A comprehensive dataset of functions, their derivatives, corresponding differential equations, and the steps to reverse the process.
- Training data that includes both straightforward analytical solutions and complex transformations.
- A robust foundation for training LLMs to handle mathematical proofs and theorem generation.

#### 7. Timeline
1. **Week 1-2:** Select functions and compute derivatives.
2. **Week 3-4:** Formulate differential equations and simulate the reverse process.
3. **Week 5-6:** Document the process and generate the training dataset.
4. **Week 7-8:** Validate the dataset and refine the approach based on initial findings.

#### 8. Conclusion
This research will provide a systematic approach to generating training data for LLMs by focusing on differentiation and integration of functions with closed-form solutions. By simulating the reverse process, we aim to create a robust and comprehensive dataset that can enhance the capabilities of LLMs in mathematical theorem proving and generation.
