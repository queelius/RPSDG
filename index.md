# Reverse-Process Synthetic Data Generation: Automatically Generating Training Large Language Models for Complex Problem Solving

## Abstract:
This paper introduces a methodology for generating high-quality, diverse training data for Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex problem-solving domains. Our approach, termed "Reverse-Process Synthetic Data Generation" (RPSDG), inverts traditionally difficult problems to create an abundance of training examples with known solutions. By automating the generation of problems of graduating difficulty, we create datasets that enable process-supervised training of LLMs. We demonstrate the efficacy of this method for taining mathematical reasoning. Our results show significant improvements in LLMs' problem-solving capabilities, particularly in areas requiring multi-step reasoning and creative insights. This methodology not only enhances model performance but also provides a framework for generating explainable AI solutions, as the step-by-step problem-solving process is inherent in the training data.
