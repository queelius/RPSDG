# Reverse-Process Synthetic Data Generation (RPSDG)

## Abstract
This paper introduces a methodology for generating high-quality, diverse training data for Language Models (LMs) in complex problem-solving domains. Our approach, termed "Reverse-Process Synthetic Data Generation" (RPSDG), inverts traditionally difficult problems to create an abundance of training examples with known solutions. By automating the generation of problems of graduating difficulty, we create datasets that enable process-supervised training of LLMs. We demonstrate the efficacy of this method for taining mathematical reasoning. Our results show significant improvements in LLMs' problem-solving capabilities, particularly in areas requiring multi-step reasoning and creative insights. This methodology not only enhances model performance but also provides a framework for generating explainable AI solutions, as the step-by-step problem-solving process is inherent in the training data.

## Introduction
Researchers in artificial intelligence and machine learning are seeking methods to enhance the problem-solving capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in domains requiring complex reasoning. We present **Reverse-Process Synthetic Data Generation** (RPSDG), a process-supervision approach to automatically generate training data for improving mathematical reasoning in LLMs.
RPSDG addresses a fundamental challenge in AI training: the scarcity of high-quality, diverse data for complex problem-solving tasks.



As a proof of concept, our method focuses on two important areas of mathematics: algebraic manipulation and integral calculus. We generate synthetic datasets of problems and solutions, providing step-by-step reasoning for each problem. This approach enables the training of LLMs on the process of problem-solving, not just the outcomes.

## Methodology

**Algebraic Reasoning**: We employ symbolic manipulation techniques and controlled random walks through expression spaces to generate complex algebraic identities. This process allows for the creation of a wide range of algebraic problems with solution steps.

**Integral Calculus**: For integration problems, we invert the traditional approach. Starting with functions that are the results of integration, we differentiate them to create integration problems with guaranteed solutions.

**Scalable Complexity**: The system allows for fine-tuning of problem difficulty, enabling the creation of datasets suitable for curriculum learning approaches.

**Process Supervision**: Each generated problem includes a step-by-step solution, facilitating the training of LLMs not just on problem outcomes, but on the reasoning process itself.

## Potential Impact

This approach has implications beyond immediate improvements in mathematical problem-solving. It provides a framework for generating explainable AI solutions, as the step-by-step problem-solving process is inherent in the training data. Furthermore, the principles of RPSDG may be adaptable to other domains requiring complex reasoning.

## Future Directions

While our current focus is on algebra and calculus, future work may extend this methodology to other areas of mathematics and potentially to fields outside of mathematics that require similar types of structured reasoning, like computer science, software engineering, and physics. A simple example in software engineering is taking working code and generating a series of bugs that need to be fixed, along with the correct solutions. This also represents a reverse process (RPSDG), as instead of going from buggy code to working code, we are going from working code to buggy code with a known solution.

We invite the research community to explore our methodology, contribute to its development, and investigate its applications. Our implementation is available as an open-source project, with the aim of fostering collaborative advancement in this area of AI research.
